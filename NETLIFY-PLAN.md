# CHRYSALIS PRESENCE - Netlify Implementation Plan 🦋

## 🎯 Project Overview
We're building a mindfulness web application that deploys to Netlify with:
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless)
- **Database**: Netlify-compatible options
- **Deployment**: Automated via Netlify CLI/Git

## 📋 Information I Need From You

### 1. **Deployment Preferences**
- [ ] Do you want to connect a custom domain? If yes, what domain?
- [ ] Should I set up automatic deployments from Git? (recommended)
- [ ] Do you want environment variables for different stages (dev/prod)?

### 2. **Database Choice** (Pick One)
- [x] **Netlify Blobs + KV** (Native Netlify database services)
- [ ] **FaunaDB** (Netlify's recommended serverless DB)
- [ ] **Airtable** (Simple, visual database)
- [ ] **Firebase Firestore** (Google's NoSQL database)
- [ ] **Local Storage + JSON files** (Simplest, no external DB)

### 3. **Authentication Method** (Pick One)
- [ ] **Netlify Identity** (Built-in auth service)
- [ ] **Auth0** (Third-party auth provider)
- [ ] **Firebase Auth** (Google authentication)
- [ ] **Simple email/password** (Custom implementation)

### 4. **Features to Prioritize** (Check all you want)
- [ ] User authentication and profiles
- [ ] Real-time presence detection
- [ ] Community features (friends, groups)
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Offline functionality (PWA)
- [ ] Analytics and progress tracking
- [ ] Daily wisdom quotes
- [ ] Breathing session recordings

### 5. **Content Management**
- [ ] Where should wisdom quotes come from? (JSON file, CMS, API)
- [ ] Do you want an admin panel to manage content?
- [ ] Should users be able to submit their own quotes?
